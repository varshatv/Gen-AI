#Generative AI Project

Welcome to the **Generative AI Project** repository! These projects leverage state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to generate [text/images/music/code/other content types] using generative models like [GPT, Stable Diffusion, GANs, etc.].

## Project Overview

This project explores the capabilities of Generative AI. It includes:

- Model training and fine-tuning
- Inference and content generation
- Evaluation metrics and visualization
- Deployment setup

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers / Diffusers
- OpenAI API / Stability AI
- Streamlit / Gradio (for UI, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
